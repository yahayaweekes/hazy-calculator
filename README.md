# Hazy Calculator

## Instructions
In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with a basic project setup as well as a set of tests which currently fail. Your task is to create a `calculate` function which will properly calculate the answer given the array of values given the rules outlined below.

## Calculation Rules
The `calculate` function runs an arithmetic calculation based upon an array of inputs (eg. `[2, '*', 10]`)

Each input should be either a number or an operand (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)

Our upstream data is inconsistent, so we _intentionally_ accept it and deal with it in the following ways:
* Stringified numbers (eg. `'2'`) should be treated as numbers
* `NULL` should be treated as zero
* `undefined` values should be ignored
* Empty string (eg. `''`) values should be ignored
